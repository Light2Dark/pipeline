My second week in campus and i have encounter a racist f**k. So im half chinese and malay and my looks are leaning towards the chinese side. Hence there is always a misconception that im chinese. So today, we created a group for our group assignment. I had another friend who also had a muslim name. I sat with a group of chinese guys (very outgoing and talkative). We never introduced ourselves so he doesnt know my name. As we we were looking at the list of names, he saw 2 muslim names and that group was the only group without enough people. So, he said „not to be racist but i know why people wont join this group“. Insinuating that my chinese classmates dont want to be group members with malay names. Little did he know i was beside him. If this is what campus life is, and ur still racist when choosing ur friends, i think you should start to realise that you should question ur self being in this world. I feel like being malay in taylors is a minority. I wish this place could be more open to people with muslim names.","#TCP329703

Fxxk me hard before you go
Let me feel like a soaring eagle
It hurts deep, when I feel this low
You're so hot, it almost looks illegal

To say I am depressed would be an understatement. I went home to try to reconcile and talk to my parents, but they won't budge. Seems to me, it is only a matter of time before they disown me. They seem very disheartened, and the only choice is if I repent and perhaps even quit college and go home to be the nice Catholic girl they perceive me to be. It appears that my parents would rather I stay home and be docile, perhaps even useless as long as I rekindle their faith and never again go against their belief.

Tried, I tried to reason with them. As per advice by my therapist, I tried to acknowledge their disappointment. I told them I can understand if they are angry at me for my immoral lifestyle. I told them I can learn, I can help myself but what I cannot promise is that I will be a Christian again. Because in my heart, I know that I am meant to be faithless. Somehow, they are not having it. I swallowed my pride and begged, as I still love them as they are my parents anyhow. They seem to believe that the only right way to live life is the Godly way. They insists that even if I stop hooking up and all that, they will only accept me IF I find my way back into their faith. Theirs. Not mine.

I told them this would not be possible and just like that they told me not to talk to them again until I do. I walked away as though I felt nothing, I went back into my dorm and broke down. In a fit of rage I have wrecked my mirror and hurt myself. Took me a while, a couple of jxxxxs and fucking Oxxx to get my shit together. I must not give in. I know. Depressed or not, nothing stops me from my career goals. I might even have to drop out, and I will if that's what it takes to achieve my dreams.

I have told my parents that they can stop funding me from now on. I told them if they want to disown me, they just have to have the balls to say it because I will NEVER. NEVER again be a Christian. I told them it is wrong for them to force me to believe in something I no longer have my heart in. I still love them but I think in time my love for them will fade away. And I don't look forward to that. But I have to. I cannot forsake my dreams in any way even for them. None of them have the balls to reply me. But I have deleted their chats, and I have outed myself from the family chat.

Perhaps, this is all the more reasons to push harder and never again look back. I might always feel horny before, but now I am between docile and celibate to extremely horny. Depression is a killer but I won't ever lose. I have my pride, ego or whatever. I won't quit and there are people who would support me anyway. My sister still loves me and wish my parents aren't so harsh but it is what it is.

Maybe I have cried and had a breakdown bad enough that my throat is still sore from screaming. It is hard to carry on without love from my parents, maybe I deserved it. And they won't understand what I have gone through, and them being overly protective had a lot to do with it. At least from now on, no one can say the only reason I succeed one day is due to my parents. From this moment on, I can honestly say they have done fxxx all and I told them already I want none of their money. Either I fund my own studies or I will quit and pursue my goals on my own.

Thanks to the network I have made, I am lucky that I have support. At this point, I really would rather die than to quit.

For those of you who show love and support, I will never forget it. Hxxxx I might be, but ungrateful I am NEVER! 😉😉😉","#TCP329693

I told them it is wrong for them to force me to believe in something I no longer have my heart in. I still love them but I think in time my love for them will fade away. And I don't look forward to that. But I have to. I cannot forsake my dreams in any way even for them. None of them have the balls to reply me. But I have deleted their chats, and I have outed myself from the family chat.

Perhaps, this is all the more reasons to push harder and never again look back. I might always feel horny before, but now I am between docile and celibate to extremely horny. Depression is a killer but I won't ever lose. I have my pride, ego or whatever. I won't quit and there are people who would support me anyway. My sister still loves me and wish my parents aren't so harsh but it is what it is.

Maybe I have cried and had a breakdown bad enough that my throat is still sore from screaming. It is hard to carry on without love from my parents, maybe I deserved it. And they won't understand what I have gone through, and them being overly protective had a lot to do with it. At least from now on, no one can say the only reason I succeed one day is due to my parents. From this moment on, I can honestly say they have done fxxx all and I told them already I want none of their money. Either I fund my own studies or I will quit and pursue my goals on my own.

Thanks to the network I have made, I am lucky that I have support. At this point, I really would rather die than to quit.

For those of you who show love and support, I will never forget it. Hxxxx I might be, but ungrateful I am NEVER! 😉😉😉",,,2022-09-08 00:04:54,1662566694,,https://scontent.fkul8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/m1/v/t6/An_UvxJXg9tdnLU3Y5qjPi0200MLilhzPXUgxzGjQzUMaNcmjdZA6anyrngvkdub33NZzZhd51fpCAEzNHFhko5aKRFP5fS1w_lKwYrzcNLupv27.png?ccb=10-5&oh=00_AT_qbKYI6IncUXkLfSdqrKOqv1pHI_hCEdutUDSRxviP2w&oe=63218CF9&_nc_sid=55e238,,,,,,,,,4,2,1,https://facebook.com/taylorsconfessions1/posts/620767182736494,,106408717505679,Taylors Confessions,https://facebook.com/taylorsconfessions1/?__tn__=C-R,False,False,,,,,,4,,106408717505679

She let's you hold her hand, hug her and even kiss her but that doesn't necessarily mean she gives you permission to touch her private parts.
A lot of guys have this thinking of ""she allows me to hug and kiss her and be intimate with her so that means she ok with me touching those parts"" which isn't necessarily that being the case with every women.

Some are okay and fine with it if a guy touch her private parts when she and the guy are already in a relationship but there are also those who aren't ok with letting their partners touch them there just because they're in a relationship. As a guy, you shouldn't take that being in a relationship with her means that you automatically get green light to touch her wherever you want.

I'm not saying that it's wrong to want to touch your partner and be intimate be it that you are a man or a woman because that's actually something normal.

It is better to ask for her consent first before you touch her private parts. What if she says that you ruin the mood for asking and said that you should have just follow the flow? For that, even I don't have an answer. If follow what she says and next time you being intimate with her then you touch her without asking for her consent beforehand, she might ask why aren't you asking for her consent before doing so?

Anyways communicate well with your partner because communication is the key to better understand one another.","#TCP329678

On a different note but also not completely unrelated, social media has been so impactful and important in this current age that people can easily get informations & news updates just through social media alone. It's a good thing but it can also be a double aged sword.

This is kind of a funny story.

There was once in which I was with with my gf in her room. We were both in the mood to do it (I'm sure you know what I mean by 'it') and we already have thought throughly bout it (It wasn't done at a whim).
It was both our first time so of course nervous lah. We tried keeping calm and do as if we're experienced what we doing although we clearly have no prior experience. Thinking back, it was funny but also sweet that we learned it together.
Like I said that this is kind of a funny story so it isn't about how I lost my V-card to her and me being her first time but still I need to elaborate a little.
We took it slowly and I know from reading that foreplay is really important so I tried to do as best as I could to pleasure her. While at it, I have her turn around (her back facing me while lying down) and I took that opportunity to pulls her pants alongs with undergarment down. If was at her home and she was wearing her casual home shorts so it was not that difficult to remove em.
She looked at me and I remembered her expression at that time showed that she was really nervous and scared. Later after the whole thing, I asked her and she said she thought I was about to do it through the other hole but let's get back to the story. I went ahead and give kisses on her butt cheeks and after some time I started eating her out (I don't think I need to explain on that). She asked ask me to stop and move away but I continued because I thought that she was just embarrassed about it. I told her there's no need to be shy about it and she's told me that isn't the case. It was something else and I found out in a not so good way. The reason she asked me to stop and move away was because she was actually trying real hard at holding her gas in from coming out. I found it out in a not so good way and that's because I was still in midst of eating her out, she eventually couldn't hold it anymore and farted directly at my face. That's not all because the previous day she actually ate both petai and durian so I'm sure just thinking bout it, you know what that smells like. To end it, we didn't end up going all the way that day. Till this day, we still laugh about it.","#TCP329672

There was once I went on a date with this one guy whom I have been chatting for some time and it all went well (kinda) so at the end of date, we hugged (now I think of it, it's a bit weird when it was the first date) and during that time when we hugged I felt that his d*ck (I assume it's his D, I didn't checked) was hard because I felt something poking me around that part. It felt awkward because I never been in such situation before and I don't know is it because he h*rny or something else. Tbh I was kinda scared too.

So here's questions I want to ask you guys;
📌 Is it normal for you guys to get an erection when on a date or when hugging a girl?
📌 Do guys only get hard when they h*rny?
📌 Should I a girl be flattered that he's hard because of me (possibly)?

To girls;

Any of you all been in somewhat similar situation before and how did you all reacted to it?","#TCP329662

I'm a girl and my bxxbs are not too small neither are they too big but compared to all the other girls around the campus they are average to medium. I have always seen quite many flat chested around me so I often tend to stand out. Few tight clothes just make they look a little bigger. I'm always overthiking and very conscious around males whether they will keep noticing it and sxxualizing it. Ofc not all males do that but I have few males friends and they really notice and talk about other girls bxxbs.
To me and for few other girls commenting on bxxbs or the way our body looks is not a good comment. Commenting on how curvy a girl is or how big her bxxbs makes her feel as though you are using her for her body.

Make her feel safe and not threatened:)",,,2022-09-02 01:50:04,1662054604,,https://scontent.fkul8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/m1/v/t6/An_UvxJXg9tdnLU3Y5qjPi0200MLilhzPXUgxzGjQzUMaNcmjdZA6anyrngvkdub33NZzZhd51fpCAEzNHFhko5aKRFP5fS1w_lKwYrzcNLupv27.png?ccb=10-5&oh=00_AT_qbKYI6IncUXkLfSdqrKOqv1pHI_hCEdutUDSRxviP2w&oe=63218CF9&_nc_sid=55e238,,,,,,,,,4,0,0,https://facebook.com/taylorsconfessions1/posts/616848899794989,,106408717505679,Taylors Confessions,https://facebook.com/taylorsconfessions1/?__tn__=C-R,False,False,,,,,,4,,106408717505679

I'm gonna be real for this one, because there's something in this that reminds me of something personal.

There have been cases of men who - after one bad experience - turned from being very expressive and open about their feelings, to completely shut down. Like, they do have feelings, but they couldn't bring themselves to say it, in the event that expressing such feelings would bite them back in the ass again. After all, they're putting their ego and reputation on the line showing their weak side just to say how much they love someone, only to look silly at the end when things go unexpectedly south.

So all I can say is, let it be as it is. You've said it there ""action speaks louder than words"". If you can't tolerate this, for one reason or another, seek reassurance from him. Ask him if he loves you, at least once or twice a week. Who knows? Over a longer period of time, he'd eventually make it a point to open up his feelings once in a while.","#TCP329645

I love my girlfriend a lot but there are times I kinda don't understand her.

For instance, I don't get it as to why she likes to fart directly at me. I mean literally directly at me. I very well understand that woman like other human beings and even animals release gas through their b***hole and it's something normal. I don't mind if she farts when she around me because in a way that means she comfortable around me and like I said, releasing gas is just normal but what I don't get is why she needs to direct it at me.

For example, while we Netflixing (without the chill because we actually watching) when she wants to fart or about to, she can just fart while sitting down but instead of that she would have her ass face where my direction is then only she farts.

I don't understand. Could it be that she has some fetish? Instead of smelling a partner's fart, she has the opposite of having her partner (which is me) smell hers?

Does anyone have same experience?","#TCP329619

Here’s a guide on how to approach women, written by a woman:

1. Yes I agree, be honest with your intentions from the start (meaning like maybe after 2-3 weeks of talking). It could be as simple as “I really like talking to you/ you’re so fun to be around, and I think I’m starting to fall for you hahah” be casual, if you’re already friends then go full-on confession if you want. Most women like being chased and it’ll keep you in the fore front of our minds instead of losing interest and moving onto someone else who’s more forward.
2. Asking for insta: Talk a bit longer first. Don’t just go “btw what’s your instagram” right after “hi I think you’re really pretty, my name is xxx, what’s yours?” that’s creepy la. maybe build your way up by asking what she studies or complementing her outfit. Something smart I taught my guy friend to do is ask whether she finished her classes for the day and if she says she has classes soon/ going to somewhere on campus to study, offer to walk her there then naturally hit her with the “btw, can I follow you on ig?”
3. You don’t always have to talk about things you have in common only and then get left with awkward silence thinking there’s nothing else to talk about. Ask about her hobbies and other things, show her you’re supportive and interested even if you don’t know wtf is she talking about 😂
4. DON’T, I repeat, DON’T just start randomly holding our hands and touching our hips. Simple touches would be like maybe your shoulder bumping my shoulder when we walk 😂 Just ask first? “do you mind if I hug you/ hold your hand?”.","#TCP329618

挂在嘴边希望孩子愧疚的人。

你的穷不是孩子造成的。
但孩子的阴影，
童年的苦却是你带来的。

你生不生小孩，都需要钱生活。
你有没有小孩，都需要努力工作。

所以不要总说“因为孩子”，
这种看似伟大实则绑架的话。

看看自己平凡的条件，
从基因外型，
到脾气性格，
再到家庭条件。

坦白说，孩子如果能选谁当父母，
你其实没什么竞争力。

放下当父母高高在上的样子。
别太高估了自己。

不管任何时候，
孩子都不应该是你失败人生的挡箭牌。
都不该推他来承担你的无能。

生了他，养他，
给吃给穿给住，
花时间照顾他，
是应该的。

那不叫奉献，不叫牺牲。

如果你还没ready承担，
那就别生小孩。

大哥大姐们，
法治社会，
弃养孩子是犯法的。

别老奢望孩子愧疚，
让他一辈子都有阴影。

I noticed a lot of people here tend to be shy of women
So heres a guide
1. Women are human beings. Thats all. Whatever you want, they probably want
So, don’t befriend them and look to try to get them with you later on. Be frank with your intentions but be polite. Imagine if a woman approached you, how would you want her to.
Just ask them for coffee, get to know them, let them know they’re beautiful but don’t take it too far. Hold their hands while crossing the street. Hold the door for them.
2. Simple touches. You don’t ask them for a hug right away. Touch their shoulders when you can. Hold their hand or arm while crossing the street. Maybe pull them by the hips instead of the hands once you get them a bit more comfortable with it but be natural. This is a way to test if they like you based on their reaction and it naturally rigs them to see you as a partner or interest granted you flirt also.
3. Just be honest! You want an FWB, say it. You want a girlfriend, say it from the start, you want a friend? Ig say that ahaha

Good luck!","#TCP329601

From the mind that brought you how to find h*rny people on dating apps (run two profiles, etc.)

So recently I got into a really intense relationship. Everything happened so quickly. When it was good, it was amazing, but when she picked a fight...damn it was like fireworks in the kitchen. So damn explosive. So this goes back and forward. Things are great (and wild!) and then she explodes in fits of rage. She's attractive and tbh I'm kinda seduced by the drama. A friend of mind who's training to be a therapist says she sounds ""borderline"" whatever that means.

Anyway we keep going off and then back together again. I get to the point where I can't take the drama any more and ask her to leave me alone. She refuses and tells me how much she wants to ""work at us"" etc. Real scary stuff. So OK, I give it another try. Within two days she explodes real bad. We argue as usual and she does her ""I don't think I can do this..."" line. So here's the twist.

Instead of getting to the point where we go back and forth and I say, ""Yeah...I can't do this either. Just please leave me alone"" I switch it up (coz that line doesn't work). So instead I get super clingy. I say I've never felt this way before, now I can see us growing old together, I mention love (but not saying ""I love you"" - too much), and I tell her all I want is her, she's so amazing, blah blah blah. I really lay it on thick.

So now she's overwhelmed and replies, ""I don't think I can be who you need me to be. I have so much to work on myself and I can't commit to something this big."" Such a different tone from refusing to let me leave! I ease back a little bit so's not to be suspicious and say, ""You know, I really would love for us to try to work things out - you're my baby...want to grow old together, etc. But if this is what you need, I respect your decision and the guy who ends up with you is gonna be one lucky fella.""

Now she's really sweet, thanking me for the compliment but she just doesn't think it's going to work. Since then, I haven't heard from her since, when she used to message ALL the time.

So the lesson? If you want out of a relationship but it's too tricky for whatever reason, don't fight the resistance. Don't attack, don't criticise. Instead, lay on your ""love"" really thick - like, really thick - and trust me, even the most romantic types will freak out. But you have to do it enough that it scares them but not so much that it's creepy because if that's not your character, they'll know you're BS'ing.

And bonus point - you get to sound like the sweet guy. I had some friends of hers tell me they heard I ""took the breakup really bad"" and felt so strongly for her. ""You're a great guy, I'm sure you'll find someone soon."" Yep, I'm going on a date with one of the friend's friends next week.

Keep this in your pocket guys. It works like a charm to help you get rid of the crazy relationship and still come out looking like the poor sweet soul in need of comforting.","#TCP329591

And I wanted to pursue finance courses at Taylor's because I know that they have the financial trading lab facility which very much fits into my interest! I think the course fee is around 100k? I'm worried that I'll be looked down on if I studied at Taylor's because I know I wouldn't have that much of extra money to go around with friends, I don't really mind actually but we all know that many people here are from rich families?

Hi, it's me the h**ny poet sis. I know I normally write my h**ny poems and all but as of last night I have to say I have been ""officially"" depressed. My worst nightmare came true.

Yes, my parents found out about what I have been doing all this while and basically the new me since university started. Of course, they were extremely disappointed that in spite of their Catholic upbringing I turned out to be a s*x addict and have been hiding it and obviously lying about still being faithful and all that. I never have a choice to begin with, my discovery and embrace of my true self was inevitable. I started questioning my faith years ago and perhaps unlike my sister, I loved asking questions and eventually my curiosity made me realized that I have been living blind all my life.

My dad wanted me to even take a break from studies until I have ""repented"" and he even said he will not let me live alone again. He said he would rather send me to campus anytime I need to, and he wants to control me. I told him that will not be possible as I refused to be controlled, and besides my studies I have my endeavors. It is keeping me busy, and it is obviously good for my future. In the end, an argument led him to threaten to stop funding my studies and eventually I will have to drop out and return home.

To his disappointment, I told him I have been earning enough to fund my own studies actually. And with or without his funding, I will continue on my entrepreneurial journey. I have never depended on him when it comes to my career anyway, and I told him it will be a lot harder for me to have to fund my studies at the same time but I will. And if I have to quit, I will do it at my own volition. But nothing will stop me from being an entrepreneur and run on my own steam. I told him and mum that they are selfish because they want me to become who they think I should become. And they are forcing their beliefs on me.

Dad refused to say more but clearly show his disappointment. As much as I have to stand my ground, and I am proud I did. But the thing is, whether I agree or disagree with them they are my parents. And I still love them. They probably don't love me anymore by now. Because I am not the ""good girl"" I thought I was. For people like them with their blind faith, they would rather see me be an average girl as long as I continue to go to church and all that. Well, at least I no longer have to pretend to still be a godly woman.

Needless to say, my relationship with them is now strained. I never come clean about what's really going on with my life all these years, because I knew all along that they won't take it too well. They might even disown me. They are good parents. Now, I am in a quandary. I cannot live my life the way they want me to, yet I don't want our bond to be strained this way. But down inside, I knew sooner or later they might find out. I just didn't want to think about it. After all, how long can I hide it from my own parents? Someone told them, and when they confronted me face to face I simply could not lie anymore. According to them, they have even seen screenshots. It could be anyone I know, anyone who's beefing with me or whatever.

They wouldn't say who, but I guess that's not important anymore. Now that everything is out of the woodwork, there is simply nowhere to hide. I will know soon enough if my dad is going to continue to pay for my studies or not, but I have to be strong because life goes on. My next session with my therapist will be in 4 days, but I guess I needed a rant to release for now.

I cried last night. For the first time ever, I have to tell my partners I wasn't feeling well and they had to discuss without me. I never missed a discussion whether on zoom on face to face, not even on my first day of period. I cried half the night, smoked countless joints. Later I will have to meet up with Mike and Chun Yang. Okay, these aren't really their real names. At this time, only my sister still cares for me. Both my parents, perhaps they need time but chances are they will not love me the way they used to anymore. I don't blame them, but I wish it doesn't have to be this way.

Maybe I don't deserve sympathy I know. I chose this life. My sexual awakening was the beginning, but instead of resisting I somehow felt like that was me all along. I am h**ny and sexually active, I never was celibate or somehow just wanted to devote my life to God and his ways. I was simply raised and conditioned to believe in it, something my parents will never understand. Perhaps, it is wrong for me to expect them to.

But hey, I guess sooner or later I will be okay. And maybe I'd have the inspiration to write more juicy stuff later? Who knows. After all, depressed or not it wouldn't make my any less horny and if anything I sense that it'd get worse. Lmao. But hopefully, I'd find something healthier or better to cope with when I see my therapist later.

So you guys, enjoy the rest of your weekend! 😊😊😊","#TCP329572

(This is part of life, you got to face it) and don’t worry you will find ways/ solution to avoid.. and over come that kind of situation when you are familiar with their so called “patterns” later.

My solution will be in a uni always, be an outgoing, extrovert person. At the same time or at some point you have to be alone or a lone ranger too (more than being extrovert) it really helps. And, try to ignore when you meet “those” who said “hi” 😶 and be natural, coz you can’t be too friendly tbh thats when advantages and trouble looking for you.","#TCP329558

Hello everyone!
First of all, thank you for your time.

I'm Lai Syer Chian from the Faculty of Communication and Creative Industries. I am a Year 3 student, studying Bachelor of Communication (Honours) in Journalism at a university in Malaysia.

First and foremost, I am working on a research pertaining to online health news as a part of the final year project. This survey is to collect information regarding credibility assessment patterns, health literacy level and behavioural responses from local university students who have consumed online health news.

All informations gathered will be kept confidential and your data won't be sold so it would be nice if you take part in this.

Finally, I would like to thank all of you who took the time to answer each question and I hope you had a great time.

I think I seriously need psychiatric help but I don't know how to tell my parents as I cannot afford it myself. I know it's stulud but I am sort of in a mame belief relationship. Mxxxxxx and I broke up more than a year ago. And I spent months trying to get over him. We have dated since 16 and I guess after 6 years of being together I simply cannot stomach the idea that I will have to move on without him.

The reason was, according to him we were not maturing together. I have always been that same girl he knew in secondary school, while he had been progressing. It was particularly hard during lockdowns, as he always thought of ways to improve himself and make changes as well as adapting to life in general.

I realized the only way I could move on was to pretend he was still around. Sometimes I cook for 2. Sometimes when I need someone to talk to, I talk to 'him' or just imagine we are cuddling. I have somewhat matured now, and I wish he is single now. But he is in a happy relationship with Sxxx and according to him, he is really happy and plans to get engage after graduation. I am nothing like Stef, she is not only pretty but enterprising just like him.

Unlike her I wasn't able to really help out and be part of his business. Now they are both partners in business and in life. I love Mxxxxx so much, I literally once begged him on my knees to give me another chance. Stef knew about me, yet she is so mature she did not hate me but encouraged me to move on.

She had asked me out a few times, to help me to carry on with life and I pretended I have been. Truth is I am very jealous, and as selfish as it is I wish they would break up. I have once even told Mxxxxx I don't mind if we cheat, and Sxxx never had to know. He refused and he did not tell Sxxx about it.

Sxxx is nice to me. I should not be jealous, but seeing her only reminds me of how much I miss him. All I have is 6 years of memories with him, and she has him for real.

It hurts so bad, because I want him to be happy too. Yet I can't let him go. Sometimes I feel like crying out of nowhere because everything reminds me of us. I really don't know what to do, if I have to get psychiatric help I need to tell my parents. But they will be disappointed, because they have no idea that I have not moved on.

I have had some hook ups and it only made the hurt deeper. I don't know what else to do, slowly this fantasy of me and him being together is 'disappearing'. I don't know how to help myself anymore. Maybe I am pathetic. I admit I am weak and useless.

I should not let a break up stop me from living. But I can't and I guess I am just not good enough.","#TCP329532

I was having a conversation with a psychology (masters) lecturer. Asked about becoming a therapist. Pretty much the same response others have given here.

“Some of the most unethical therapists are the most well known. They talk a good game and are legit practitioners and teachers. But their practice off social media/in private would get their licence taken away elsewhere. It’s easier to be in Malaysia, but train overseas if you want to be a good therapist.”","#TCP329530

Call me a chick
I'd make you eggs
Fore I suck your d
Then I'd spread my legs

Got this inspiration, smokes after sxx then scrambled eggs for breakfast. For those guys who can last long or those who take pills, I usually perform my signature ""no hands"" fexxxxo where I put both hands on the back, practically covering my axxx as I suck.

It only works if his erection is rock solid. But I don't do this for everyone though I like giving fxxxxxo first, because I tend to take control when I do. Then again I have to be selective.

Funny I recalled last week, I had a tummy ache shortly after sxx with Jxxxxxxx. Then I found out he has a sxxt fetish. He deliberately entered the bathroom while I was defecating just to see ""if I was okay"" 😏😏😏

Smooth way to watch mr and get turned on while looking like he was just caring. I wasn't uncomfortable though, that wasn't the first time. Even spread my knees wider apart at one point when I urinate.

He even asked me if I could bxxx him. Told him ""Maybe after I cleaned up!"" and he waited willingly.

But he wanted me to remain seated on the toilet. Oh my... 🤣","#TCP329529
